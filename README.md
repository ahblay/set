# set
The game of Set programmed in Arcade. Can be used as an interface for playing on a computer, or for training ML classifiers.

OH MY GOD LORD HAVE MERCY ON MY SOUL. 
I just spent an hour when I should have been sleeping trying to figure out which version of arcade I used when I initially wrote this. What a fucking nightmare rabbithole that was.
If anyone ever wants to run this and have it work, here's what you need:

pip install arcade==1.3.7

Newer versions of arcade implemented a new way of using sound files or some other garbage and it runs hella slow. Even newer versions scaled all arcs by 2, so the cards look trippy and wrong. You're welcome.
